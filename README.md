# Pequeñas Violencias
Essentials I used to create the record "Pequeñas Violencias" with Theremin and Machine Learning: https://antisentido.bandcamp.com/album/peque-as-violencias

Pequeñas Violencias is a collection of improvisations with theremin and machine learning.
I used the amazing software Wekinator: https://github.com/fiebrink1/wekinator

As inputs I used a Max/MSP patch that extracted 5 audio features from the theremin (based on Analyzer by Tristan Jehan: http://web.media.mit.edu/~tristan/maxmsp.html).
As an output I used a Supercollider Patch with 5 controls. It implements two granular synths in which I used different buffers. The receiver is based on the Weki example by Rebecca Biebrink
